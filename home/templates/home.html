	Are App Stores Still Growing?</h3>

<p>Starting with one of the questions we field most often — growth.</p>

<p>To answer this question, let&#8217;s look at the number of apps available for download at the end of every year for the past few years.</p>

<p>Both Apple&#8217;s App Store and Google Play were growing consistently all the way up to 2017, when they split. Google Play continued to grow at a pretty good rate of about 30% to more than 3.6 million apps. </p>

<p>Apple&#8217;s App Store however, headed in a very different direction. It shrunk. At the end of 2017 there were roughly 2.1 million iOS apps available in the App Store, a decrease of 5% when compared to the 2.2 million apps that were available in the beginning of the year.</p>

<p>The decline is a result of stricter enforcement of Apple&#8217;s review guidelines, as well as a technical change that eliminated many old apps that were not updated to support 64-bit architecture.</p>

<h3>How Many New Apps Are Released Every Year?</h3>

<p>Apple&#8217;s willingness to shrink its store in favor of better quality, while admirable, is not the only reason for the decrease. </p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at how many new apps are released every year. These include apps that were released and available on the store for at least one day. </p>

<p>Android developers kept busy, and in the last year alone released more than 1.5 million new apps. This is an increase of about 17% year over year, the largest jump since 2014. iOS developers on the other hand, took their time releasing just 755k new apps in 2017. That&#8217;s a big drop! 29% to be precise, the first drop since the App Store launched in 2008.</p>
